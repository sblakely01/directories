Backend Coding Challenge

In order to run this project, pull the repository and run "node ." in the terminal. The prompt will ask you for your list of items folloed by the word 'end'. 

I wanted to allow support for copying and pasting items as well as single line manual input, so the command 'end' must be typed in the terminal at the end of your list of directory commands in order for it to read and process the stream.

The project features:

A custom tree class I built to handle operations on the directory tree
Reusable helper functions like traverseTree and findPath
Detailed comments on the purpose of the functions

If I had been able to put more time into the project, I would have prioritized the handling of edge cases and better error handling as well as added an option to allow users to not have to type 'end' after their input
